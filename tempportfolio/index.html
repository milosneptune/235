                    I'm Milo Qureshi, I'm currently a rising junior studying Game Design and Development at
                    Rochester Institute of Technology.

                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been an artist for years. Initially, I picked up programming as a hobby but
                    was captivated by software development. 
                    
                    <br>I aim to work in an interactive field that
                    combines aesthetics and code, which led me to major in game development.
                    <br>I wish to utilize the
                    multidisciplinary aspect of games and prove how versatile the medium can be.<br><br>

                    I'm furthering my knowledge in object-oriented programming
                    languages, game engines, and web development. I'm seeking internships in interactive media, software
                    development, web development, and 3D modeling to advance my own skills.

                    <p><i>echoes</i> is a student-led vertically integrated project at Rochester Institute of
                        Technology. Each year, we examine a theme, and pick apart works from our community to explore
                        how games can foster connections. Our most recent game is Jelly Beach, a child on a boardwalk in
                        the 1960s wants nothing more than a jelly donut!

                        <br><br>My role on the Jelly Beach team is the 2D artist/animator and game developer. The
                        majority of the game art and animations was created by me. I've also programmed the player
                        running logic, NPC AI pathfinding script, and the parallax sky effect.

                    <p>Rig My Roll is a rogue-like slot machine game written in C# and the MonoGame
                        framework. It's a high-level prototype created in a team of four people, the development was
                        constrained to two weeks.

                        As a project coordinator, I was responsible for designating tasks to team members, and reviewing
                        their work to ensure it met our standards. As a game developer, I designed and programmed the
                        essential logic for the slot machine, manipulating its chances, and contributed to its user
                        interface.

                    <p> Starlit Wanderer was created as part of the Granola.gg game jam. The theme was nostalgia, so our
                        game focuses on an astronaut lost in space, and in their final moments, they reminisce on better
                        times.<br><br>
                        My role as a game developer was programming the player movement and physics, and
