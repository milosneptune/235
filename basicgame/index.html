<h4>Review</h4>
<blockquote>
    "Persona 5 is the pinnacle of the JRPG genre, showcasing for one of the few times in history 
    what it's like when a beautiful story is assisted by great gameplay. 
    <br>This is a game with a wonderful personality, and one with more content than just about any other 
    single-player game you can name."
